		<h2>Mail</h2>

<p>Confidential information may be information in any form: e.g., written, electronic, oral,

		<h2>Leave</h2>
							<b>Annual Leave</b>
<p>Annual leave can be used for whatever purposes you desire.  Most people use it for vacations and personal business.  Except for emergencies, annual leave must be authorized in advance by your supervisor.</p>  
<p>An employee accrues annual leave for each full pay period of employment unless he/she maintains a nonpay status for the entire pay period.  Annual leave is earned on the basis of the number of years of pfficial employment, including creditable military service if applicable.  The following table outlines the annual leave categories and the accrual rates for each:</p>
<p>Full-Time Employees:</p>

	</tr>
</table>
</table>

<p>Pay status hours which do not equal the number necessary for a minimum leave credit are carried over from one pay period to the next to accumulate toward future leave credits.  Employees can carry 30 days (240 hours) of unused annual leave from year to year.  You are advised to use your annual leave throughout the year in order to avoid losing accrued leave above the 30-day limit.</p>
<b>Sick Leave</b>
<p>Sick leave may be used when you: receive medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; are incapacitated by physical or mental illness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; would, because of exposure to a communicable disease, jeopardize the health of others by your presence on the job; or must be absent from work for adoption-related activities.  In addition, you may use a limited amount of sick leave to: provide care for a family member as the result of physical or mental illness, injury,
pregnancy, childbirth, or medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; or make arrangements necessitated by the death of a family member or attend the funeral of a family member.   For more information about Family Leave benefits, talk to your Supervisor and/or Human Resources.</p>
<p>For full-time employees, the sick leave accrual rate is 13 days a year; for part-time employees, it’s one hour for each 20 in pay status. There is no limit on how much can be accumulated.</p>
<p>There are other forms of leave including: compensatory time off; excused absences without loss of pay and without charge to leave; family and medical leave, seven days of paid leave each calendar year (in addition to annual or sick leave) to serve as a bone-marrow donor and 30 days to serve as an
organ donor; time off as a form of performance recognition; leave without pay used instead of paid leave for various purposes with supervisory approval; religious reasons, and military leave.</p>

		<h2>Compensation</h2>
							<p>A pay range is established for each of the organization\'s jobs and these ranges are (a) internally
equitable, i.e., fair when compared with the ranges established for other Company jobs, as well as (b)
externally competitive when compared with the rates paid by other employers for comparable jobs.
Each employee whose performance is “proficient” or better will receive a rate of pay that falls within
the pay range that has been established for his/her job.
The position of each employee\'s salary within the range that has been established for his or her job
will be determined primarily by the employee\'s relevant experience and job performance.
Company’s compensation programs are designed and administered in such a way as to comply with all
applicable laws and to provide fair and equitable treatment for all employees.</p>
<b>Regular Pay Procedures</b>
<p>All Company employees are normally paid on Fridays on a bi-weekly basis. If a scheduled payday falls
on a company-observed holiday, you will usually be paid on the day preceding the holiday. All required
deductions, such as federal, state, and local taxes, and all authorized voluntary deductions, such as
health insurance contributions, will be withheld automatically from your paycheck.
All documentation of work completed must be submitted by those staff members providing direct patient care.</p>
<b>Merit Increases</b>
<p>The purpose of merit increases is to recognize and reward employee performance over a
designated period of time, and a minimum of once a year.</p>
<b>Acting Pay</b>
<p>Acting pay may be granted when an employee is temporarily assigned, for a period of at least one
(1) week or more, to assume a substantial portion of the responsibilities of a job with a higher pay
range.</p>
<b>Overtime</b>
<p>When a Company employee is required to work more than forty (40) hours in any given work week
(Company work week is regularly a seven day, 168 hour period) the following applicable overtime
pay policies will apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Non-exempt employees are to be paid one and one-half times their ‘regular hourly rate’ for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek.</li>
  <li>Exempt employees are paid a salary commensurate with their job responsibilities regardless of the number of hours worked, and therefore are not eligible for overtime pay.</li>
</ul>
<b>On-Call Pay</b>
<p>Since some employees are required to be available for work on an on-call basis, special rates for
on-call hours will be paid to non-exempt employees. Your supervisor will notify you of proper
procedures if you are required to work on-call.</p>
<b>Bonus Pay</b>
<p>Bonus (and/or Incentive or Reward) Pay is additional compensation paid to an employee, or group
of employees, in addition to their normal rate of pay. Bonus pay may be granted only under limited
circumstances.</p>
<b>Market Adjustments</b>
<p>Market adjustments to salary ranges may occur outside of the annual Salary Planning cycle when
market demand has resulted in an increased rate of pay for a particular a job or job family.</p>
<b>Reductions In Pay</b>
<p>For a variety of reasons, an employee may be reassigned to a job that has a lower pay range than
the job they had previously held. In such cases, reduction in pay guidelines will apply.</p>
<b>Shift Differentials</b>
<p>Employees receive shift differential pay, for all hours worked, if they work a minimum of six (6)
consecutive hours during a shift where a differential applies.</p>
<b>Weekend Differentials</b>
<p>An employee who works four (4) or more consecutive hours during Company designated weekend
period is entitled to receive a weekend differential for all hours worked on that shift. For the
purposes of this policy, the weekend is defined as beginning 11:00 p.m. Friday and ending 7:00 a.m. Monday.</p>
<b>Unemployment Compensation</b>
<p>Our company  through the State Unemployment Compensation Act may provide you with income in
the event you become laid off or unemployed through no fault of your own. The entire cost of
this benefit is paid by the Company.</p>
				<div class="page-break"></div>

		<h2>Insurance</h2>
							<p><b>Health Insurance</b></p>

<p>Our Health Benefits program is designed to help protect you and eligible family members from the expenses of illness and accident.

You must enroll within 60 days of the beginning of your employment, otherwise you will have to wait until the next season.</p>

<p><b>Life Insurance</b></p>

				<div class="page-break"></div>
			<a name="LE14"></a>
		<h2>Holidays</h2>
							<p>Full-time and part-time eligible employees receive ten (10) paid (fixed) holidays. Since it is not possible for all employees to be off on a holiday, non-exempt employees who must work on these days will be paid time and a half for the hours worked. Part-time eligible employees receive pro-rated holiday hours.</p>

<p>There are 10 legal holidays:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Years Day</b> &ndash; January 1</li>

</ul>
<p>Should a holiday fall on a Saturday, the preceding Friday will be considered the paid holiday; if a holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday will be considered the paid holiday. For observance of a religious holiday, you must request your Personal Day or vacation leave.</p>				<div class="page-break"></div>
			<a name="LE15"></a>
		<h2>Open Communication Policies and Practices</h2>
							<p>Effective communication is essential to provide the best client service, maintain productivity, sustain morale and foster constructive employee relations.</p>

<b>Employees and their supervisor</b>


<p>Questions and concerns relating to job activities should be first presented to supervisors. Communication between the supervisor and the employee should be ongoing and address concerns, duties and expectations. Supervisors can help employees achieve their professional goals by providing career development information.</p>
<b>Department and unit meetings</b> 
<p>Departments and units meet to communicate goals and objectives and to discuss workplace issues of interest to employees. Employees should check with supervisors to obtain a schedule of the meetings.</p>
<b>Management Meetings</b> 
<p>All levels of management routinely hold meetings to communicate information and discuss matters of importance.</p>
				<div class="page-break"></div>
