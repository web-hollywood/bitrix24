<p>The portal offers various features for communication among its users.</p>
 
<p>The <b>Blogs</b> section shows the blogs of employees and groups. The main page of this section gives you a brief overview of all the new blogs, latest posts and user comments. </p>
 
<p>Using <b>Forums</b>, you can ask for help on a certain problem or read the existing topics of other employees. Forums are grouped in the following way:</p>
 
<ul> 
  <li><b>General Forums</b> - for example, the public forum in which any user can create topics for discussion.</li>
 
  <li><b>Forum for comments</b> - the employees can leave their comments on the company news and events here.</li>
 </ul>
 
<p>The published photos of employees and the pictures of workgroups are available for viewing in the <b>Photo Gallery</b> section. The gallery name follows the employee's name. If an employee allows viewing of their photos, the employee's personal page will open upon clicking their name.</p>
 
<p>The <b>Classifieds</b> page allows you to view advertisements of the company employees or place your own using &quot;<b>Classifieds</b>&quot;, and further view them by clicking &quot;<b>My Ads</b>&quot;.</p>
