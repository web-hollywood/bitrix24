<detail_text><![CDATA[<p><b>Health Insurance</b></p>

<p>Our Health Benefits program is designed to help protect you and eligible family members from the expenses of illness and accident.  Unlike many private sector health benefit plans, it provides coverage without physical examination, places no restrictions on age or physical condition, offers a wide range of plans to choose from, and cannot be canceled by the plan in which you enroll.  You must enroll within 60 days of the beginning of your employment, otherwise you will have to wait until the next season.</p>

<p><b>Life Insurance</b></p>
<p>Our company provides you with group life insurance valued at one times your annual income, at no charge if you are a full-time or part-time eligible employee. This insurance policy also provides remuneration for accidental death and dismemberment. You are required to sign up for this insurance and designate your beneficiary at the beginning of your employment.</p>
