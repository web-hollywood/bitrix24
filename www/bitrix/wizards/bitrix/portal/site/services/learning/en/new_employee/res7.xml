<detail_text><![CDATA[<p>We must make every effort to maintain good customer service.  Listed below are several tips for a successful telephone conversation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check voice mail frequently throughout the day.</li>
  <li>Maintain an up-to-date and accurate message at all times.</li>
  <li>Answer your phone personally whenever possible.</li>
  <li>Learn to ignore people’s indifference.  People will provoke you only if you let them.</li>
  <li>Turn negative stress into a positive force by practicing self-control and maintaining high self-esteem.</li>
  <li>Use self-discipline to maintain an ongoing dialogue; even in difficult situations.</li>
  <li>At some point in your conversation, give everyone you talk to a positive statement.</li>
  <li>Make a brief apology if there is a problem, and do it with a smile.  Callers can always hear it.</li>
  <li>Tune out distractions and concentrate on what is being said in the conversation.</li>
  <li>Let the other person talk without interrupting him/her.</li>
  <li>Improve listening by taking accurate notes.</li>
  <li>Ask questions so that you keep in tune with what the caller is thinking; as well as saying.</li>
