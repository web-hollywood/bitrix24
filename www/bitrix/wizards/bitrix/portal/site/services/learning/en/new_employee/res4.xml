<detail_text><![CDATA[<p>As an employee, you should maintain important personal documents and records.  You are responsible for ensuring that your records are current and accurate. Important records include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time and Attendance Reports</li>
  <li>Personnel Actions</li>
  <li>Performance Standards and Appraisals</li>
  <li>Position Descriptions</li>
  <li>Training</li>
  <li>Awards</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these records are filed in your Official Personnel Folder, which is kept in the Human Resources Office.  You are entitled to have access to this information.  You are, also, responsible for notifying Human Resources of any change in your name, home address, and family status.</p>
<p>You will receive a “Statement of Earnings and Leave” for each pay period that you are employed.  It is important to verify that the statement accurately reflects required and, where selected, optional deductions.  Report any errors, immediately, to your Human Resources Office.</p>
