Effectively, this means that each employee is now granted permission to view public information, and given a password to access their private area.

Configurable access to the portal areas provides us with teamwork features: we can now edit documents; create workgroups; elaborate on reports - together!

The purpose of the portal is to make the communication chain between workers as short as possible. The portal, being the fast and modern means of communication, is the best method to avoid paper work and transform the business information flow into an electronic course.
 
Using the intranet portal, the company employees can obtain any technical, reference or juridical information including the corporate standards and identity.

The users can post to forums; send requests to technical support and supply services; share and exchange documents; discuss company news and get the latest information from the company management.

The portal will become the essential part of our company's business and life!";
